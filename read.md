seems like i fixed the bugs so far seems like it is working

bugs!
1.
tldr: the getInput() if statement isn't working correctly

solved: getInput() is working



1. tldr: the if else part of getGuesses has an unusual bug, maybe because recursive?
   
Solved: turned the if else into a while loop and added a special if statement to check for NaN instead
